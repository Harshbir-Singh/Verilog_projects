Traffic Light Controller

A simple 3-way intersection traffic light controller in Verilog with emergency override.

- Features:

Controls 3 roads with red, green, yellow lights
Emergency mode switches to road with highest traffic
Outputs current road's traffic count

- How it works:

Normal operation cycles through 3 states:
State 1: Road0=Green, Road1=Yellow, Road2=Red
State 2: Road0=Red, Road1=Green, Road2=Yellow
State 3: Road0=Yellow, Road1=Red, Road2=Green
Emergency mode immediately switches to the road with most traffic.

- State Machine:

Uses 2-bit state encoding (00, 01, 10) with standard FSM structure:

- Usage:

Compile with any Verilog simulator. Create testbench with clock and input signals to observe traffic light cycling.
Reset initializes to state 1. Emergency signal overrides normal cycling.
